- **Write a 500-word explanation of Bitcoin stock-to-flow model and make an argument for why it is a bad model?**

**Answer**:

Bitcoin stock-to-flow model is a way to measure the abundance of a particular resource. The stock-to-flow model popularized by a pseudonymous **Dutch institutional investor** who operates under the Twitter account **“[PlanB](https://twitter.com/100trillionusd),”** has been widely praised and is the leading Bitcoin valuation model for Bitcoin proponents.  The model has achieved viral popularity and inspired rags-to-riches-dreams for those gambling it all on the future of Bitcoin. PlanB then argues that this same logic applies to Bitcoin, which becomes more valuable as new supply is reduced every four years, ultimately culminating in a supply of 21 million Bitcoin. Low rate of supply, which PlanB defines as “scarcity”, can be quantified using a metric called **Stock-to-Flow (SF)** which is the ratio between current supply and new supply. PlanB suggests that an investor can forecast the future USD market capitalization of Bitcoin using the above formula. This has helped give credence to those $100,000 Bitcoin projections.

This model treats Bitcoin as being comparable to commodities such as gold and silver. The model quantifies 
scarcity by taking the total global supply of a commodity and dividing it be annual production. A higher value 
means that less new supply is entering the market. That translates into more scarcity and less inflation.


Stock to Flow Model is an interesting model for measuring scarcity, but it doesn't  account for all parts of the picture. Models are only as strong as their assumptions. Stock to Flow relies on the assumption that scarcity, as measured by the model, should drive value. The model fails if Bitcoin doesn't have any other useful qualities other than supply scarcity.Gold's scarcity, predictable flow, and global liquidity have made it a relatively stable store of value compared to fiat currencies, which are prone to devaluation. According to this model, Bitcoin's volatility should also decrease over time. From a theoretical foundation, the model is based on the rather strong assertion that the USD market capitalization of a monetary good (e.g. gold and silver) is derived directly from their rate of new supply. No evidence or research is provided to support this idea, other than the singular data points selected to chart gold and silver’s market capitalization against Bitcoin’s trajectory. 

The second is the naïve application of a linear regression that results in a high probability of a researcher  
finding spurious results.  It is common for researchers to underestimate how often such techniques lead to  
spurious results. Particularly in this situation where there is a large degree of freedom in which a lot of  
random data can be fit to a specific outcome.

With these reasons, I believe Bitcoin stock-to-flow model is a bad model.

     

-  **Yara Inc is listed on the NYSE with a stock price of $40 - the company is not known to pay dividends. We need to price a call option with a strike of $45 maturing in 4 months. The continuously-compounded risk-free rate is 3%/year, the mean return on the stock is 7%/year, and the standard deviation of the stock return is 40%/year. What is the Black-Scholes call price?**

### Computer Science

- **Why is it a bad idea to use recursion method to find the fibonacci of a number?**

It is a bad idea to use recursion method to find the fibonacci of a number because recursion may cause memory overflow if the stack space is too large and also inefficient in cases where the same value is calculated again and again.



- **Write a function that takes in a Proth Number and uses Proth's theorem to determine if said number is prime? You can write this in any programming language but C/C++/Golang are preferred**
