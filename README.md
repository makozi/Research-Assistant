- Write a 500-word explanation of Bitcoin stock-to-flow model and make an argument for why it is a bad model?

**Answer**:

Bitcoin stock-to-flow model is a way to measure the abundance of a particular resource. The stock-to-flow model popularized by a pseudonymous **Dutch institutional investor** who operates under the Twitter account **“PlanB,”** has been widely praised and is the leading Bitcoin valuation model for Bitcoin proponents.  The model has achieved viral popularity and inspired rags-to-riches-dreams for those gambling it all on the future of Bitcoin. PlanB then argues that this same logic applies to Bitcoin, which becomes more valuable as new supply is reduced every four years, ultimately culminating in a supply of 21 million Bitcoin. Low rate of supply, which PlanB defines as “scarcity”, can be quantified using a metric called **Stock-to-Flow (SF)** which is the ratio between current supply and new supply. PlanB suggests that an investor can forecast the future USD market capitalization of Bitcoin using the above formula. This has helped give credence to those $100,000 Bitcoin projections.

This model treats Bitcoin as being comparable to commodities such as gold and silver. The model quantifies 
scarcity by taking the total global supply of a commodity and dividing it be annual production. A higher value 
means that less new supply is entering the market. That translates into more scarcity and less inflation.


Stock to Flow is an interesting model for measuring scarcity, but it doesn't  account for all parts of the 
picture. Models are only as strong as their assumptions. tock to Flow relies on the assumption that scarcity, as measured by the model, should drive value. The model fails if Bitcoin doesn't have any other useful qualities other than supply scarcity.Gold's scarcity, predictable flow, and global liquidity have made it a relatively stable store of value compared to fiat currencies, which are prone to devaluation. According to this model, Bitcoin's volatility should also decrease over time. From a theoretical foundation, the model is based on the rather strong assertion that the USD market capitalization of a monetary good (e.g. gold and silver) is derived directly from their rate of new supply. No evidence or research is provided to support this idea, other than the singular data points selected to chart gold and silver’s market capitalization against Bitcoin’s trajectory. 




- Yara Inc is listed on the NYSE with a stock price of $40 - the company is not known to pay dividends. We need to price a call option with a strike of $45 maturing in 4 months. The continuously-compounded risk-free rate is 3%/year, the mean return on the
stock is 7%/year, and the standard deviation of the stock return is 40%/year. What is the Black-Scholes call price?
